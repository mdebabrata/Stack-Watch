Stack-Watch
===================

This app is a notifier for [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), We all like to see, answer and learn 
from new questions right :) 

The normal way was to keep an eye on the tab to see for any updates however I found that method very
distracting since I'm busy and I don't have much time to waste looking for updates however I â™¥ StackOverflow
and so I made this app which makes a *sqeaky* beep sound if a new question was asked in your tag of interest

The app itself is pretty much not yet ready So expect a ton of bugs, and Its lacking many basic features you'd expect
but just hold on they will arrive quickly as possible :)

+1 For StackOverflow :)
