Stack-Watch
===================

This app is a notifier for [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), We all like to see, answer and learn 
from new questions right :) 

The normal way was to keep an eye on the tab to see for any updates however I found that method very
distracting since I'm busy and I don't have much time to waste looking for updates however I â™¥ StackOverflow
and so I made this app which makes a *sqeaky* beep sound if a new question was asked in your tag of interest

The app itself is pretty much not yet ready So expect a ton of bugs, and Its lacking many basic features you'd expect
but just hold on they will arrive quickly as possible :)

+1 For [**StackOverflow**](http://stackoverflow.com/) :)
---------------------------
#Documenation:

So how the heck do I use it:

- Firstly set the tags of your interest separated by commas. *eg: `python,c++,java`*

- Set the delay in minutes, Default is to 1 which means it'll check for updates every 1 minute.

- After configuring and starting the process simply close the window and It'll pop a notification whenever it senses there's a new question :)

Drawbacks:

- Only works on windows until someone implements a beep and notification system for linux and mac ;)
